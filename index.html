      <h2>Code</h2>
        <p> So! This summer I'm attending this program called Girls Who Code, which is the program that assigned me to do this which is why I'm doing this, and if you're seeing this you probably already know about this program. But anyway yeah! We've done a lot of projects, and one of the first platforms we worked on was Scratch. I liked it a lot, it was fun and cool to work with. Here are a couple of projects that I did!

            <p> In this project we had the assignment to basically create a dance party. Mine was pretty cool (cause ya know, I'M pretty cool), the guys in the front were basically in sync and the guy in the back had his own kind of solo thing.</p>

            <p> This was one of the very first projects that we did. The assignment was to basically say a few things about ourselves, so I talked about my attending a boarding school. I got my lady to look like she was actually walking too! It was cool (ofc cause i'm cool)</p>
